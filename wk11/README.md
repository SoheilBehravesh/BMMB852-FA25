*Hello* **Dr. Albert**
# Assignment for week 11 - GIAB

The aim of this week assignment is to downlaod the reference genome for a specific region of the genome and evaluate the alignment quality of the reads generated by different sequencing technologies/machines (Option 1).

The Genome In A Botttle (GIAB) is a project to create benchmarked human reference genomes so different labs can validate, compare, and standardize theor sequenicing and variant-calling pipelines against a trusted source. Cancer GIAB has the same goal but with tumor-normal pairs. 

So, the approach we took for this evaluation is first to make a design.csv file that contains the web address for downloading the reference from each sequencing technology. Then using parallel for the design file to go over our Make file, which contains the code for downloading the reference genomes and the reads from the project. At the end we can extract the quality information of each read to our reference genome to evaluate which technology produce better reads.
